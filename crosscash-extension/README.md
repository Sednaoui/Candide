# CrossCash (üêß,üêì)

A web3 crypto wallet with build-in bridge support, built as a browser extension.

At crosscash, we are building an ethereum wallet that can enable bridging of assets seamlessly, as opposed to manually moving funds from one network to the other. That allows users to interact with any contract on any network, no matter where their funds are. 

## We want to end: 

- The switching between different RPC endpoints manually
- The bridging of asset between different networks manually

## Roadmap: 

Our focus is the user experience on interoperability. Our first phase is building a wallet with existing technologies with security as our top priority.  Our next phase is to integrate a bridge that will server as the first back-end. 

Long term, we want to build a bridge aggregator of assets that would support quotes from all supported bridged.
## Developpement

In crosscash-extension, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
